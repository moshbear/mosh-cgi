==

M0shbear's fork of GNU cgicc.

Features added:
* Templated Unicode support
* OO Element
* Complete SGML DTD support
* OO Headers
* OO Cookie

Features removed:
* CGI input handling (use mosh/fcgi for that)
* redundancies in control flow (constructs like `if ((bool_val) == true)' need to be destroyed with fire)
* #ifdef __GNUC__ - removing gnu hints to cleanup code
* most of the documentation (TODO: rewrite)
* examples: don't need them
