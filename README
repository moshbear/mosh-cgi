M0shbear's fork of GNU cgicc.

Features added:
* FastCGI support via fastcgi++
* Unicode/UTF-8 support via templates

Features modified:
* Use of operator[] for form data. 2-arg overload for returning list of references for multi-value keys
* cgi::CgiInput replaced with accessors to fastcgi++ data
* replaced std::vector with std::list where needed (warn: list of non-POD data; you cannot use BigList with it)
* replaced std::string with shared_ptr to BigVector<char> for file upload 
    todo: find a way to extract filename from stxxl so that simple rename can be done, lowering space complexity by 2x

Features removed:
* cgi::CgiInput
* env vars; use cgi::Environment<T>::operator[](std::string const&) if you want the functionality
* data dumper: moved to fastcgi++
* data deserialization: let fastcgi++ do the session-specific work
* #ifdef __GNUC__ - removing gnu hints to cleanup code
* most of the documentation (TODO: rewrite)
* autoconf, automake, configure: redundant because the master Makefile already does the config.h generation
* examples: don't need them
